# Web Development Project 🚀

## About This Project

This project was **initialized** a whole year ago. And since then, it has been *fully optimized* for maximum **nothingness**. 😎

### Features
- 🗓 **Created**: 365 days ago (don't worry, we were just letting the code marinate).
- 📦 **Dependencies**: A year’s worth of unused packages. They're waiting to be called into action… someday.
- 💻 **Code**: Currently at version **0.0.0** (because we couldn't decide on what framework to use yet).
- 🌱 **Growth**: Expected to "grow" any day now. Or not. Who knows? It’s like a plant that hasn’t been watered in a while.

## How To Contribute
1. **Fork** this repo (it’s like creating a wish on a star).
2. **Open an issue** (preferably about the "lack of content").
3. **Start coding** (or just add a funny comment in a file, that works too).
4. **Send a pull request** (just don't expect us to merge anything anytime soon).

## Next Steps (2025 edition)
- Add **actual code** (we promise we’ll start writing soon).
- Create a **cool landing page** (or just change the readme every 6 months for fun).
- Test the website (when we remember to).
